> My first repository which I created when I introduced myself to git and JAVA. Archiving for the nostalgia.

# **Tick-Tack-Toe**

The old classic Game "Tick-Tack-Toe" in different environments.

1. Console-based

Written in Java. Interactive and easy to play. Brings old memories back that too within the console. Simply move the directory and type:

    $ java Play

2. Console-based 2

Extending from the previous version Console-based, it has been broken into separate classes and Enumerations for better organisation. Even added a Welcome Text. Sole purpose was for the preparation of an AI. To play, simply move the directory and type:

     $ java Play
